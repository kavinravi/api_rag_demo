PROPOSAL: Updated Remote Work Policy

Hi team,

I'd like to propose the following changes to our remote work policy:

1. Allow employees to work fully remote (5 days/week) with manager approval
2. Increase the wellness stipend from $100/month to $150/month to cover home office costs
3. Require employees to be available during core hours of 9 AM - 4 PM instead of 10 AM - 3 PM
4. Add a $500 annual home office equipment allowance

I believe these changes would improve employee satisfaction and help with recruiting.

Please review and let me know if this aligns with our current policies or if there are any conflicts.

Thanks,
Sarah
